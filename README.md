## Introduction
The **Scheduling Site** simplifies the scheduling process by requiring users to provide a unique token stored in a MySQL database. Once authenticated, users can schedule their availability for upcoming meetings, which is then stored securely in the database.

## Features

### Token Authentication
To ensure security and access control, the site utilizes token-based authentication:

- **Token Configuration:** Users must configure their token within the MySQL database.
- **Token Validation:** The site validates the user's token to grant access to the scheduling interface.
- **Security:** Protects sensitive scheduling data from unauthorized access.

### Scheduling Availability
The core feature of the site allows users to schedule their availability:

- **Intuitive Interface:** A user-friendly interface for selecting dates and times for availability.
- **Meeting Details:** Users can specify meeting details, such as purpose and location.
- **Submission:** Availability schedules are submitted and stored for reference.

### MySQL Database
The site relies on a MySQL database to:

- **Store Schedules:** All user availability schedules are securely stored.
- **Manage Tokens:** Users can configure and manage their tokens in the database.
- **Data Integrity:** Ensures data consistency and reliability.

## Getting Started
To set up the **Scheduling Site**, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/scheduling-site.git
``
2. Configure the application to connect to your MySQL database. This may involve editing a configuration file or providing environment variables.

3. Create a table in your MySQL database to store scheduling data.

4. Configure the token for user authentication and store it in your MySQL database.

5. Start the web server. The exact command may vary based on your stack (e.g., Node.js, PHP, Django).

6. Access the site by navigating to its URL in your web browser.

# Usage

1. Visit the site and enter your token for authentication.

2. Once authenticated, you can access the scheduling interface.
